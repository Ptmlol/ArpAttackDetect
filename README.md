# ArpAttackDetect
This program is used to detect if the machine is under any ARP attack.

If your machine is under any ARP MITM attack, run this program at any time and it'll display a message saying that you are under attack ( <5 seconds ).

If you are not under any attack the program will not return anything.

Use:

>python arp_detector.py --help
 to display help.
